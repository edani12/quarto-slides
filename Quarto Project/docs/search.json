    "text": "Welcome to DATASCI 350! This course introduces key tools in modern data science, focusing on three essential aspects: reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. We will cover the command-line interface, version control with Git and GitHub, and literate programming using Quarto. You will also learn about cloud computing with AWS (basics), data storage and manipulation with SQL and Pandas, and parallel computing with Dask. We will explore AI-assisted programming with GitHub Copilot and Ollama and finish with Docker and containerisation.\nWe will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 5:30pm to 6:45pm in the Psychology Building, Room 230."
